According to the original sale deed, quotation letter and affidavit given by the buyer in his evidence, even after purchasing the said land, the buyer would have less than twelve and a half acres of land. The said land is not the land covered under Section 77 of the Gram Sabha and Revenue Code, the seller and the buyer do not belong to the Scheduled Caste.
